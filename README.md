Hi, this app is for practicing everything i've learned last months.

I've made template ubuntu container on c9 - planning to use it for several rails projects in single c9 workspace, guess, it could be useful.
This one is for practicing with Rails, Postgres, Bootstrap, Angular, Rspec, Git, Nginx, Capistrano, etc.
For this moment main idea is for deploying this project to already running VNC and setup both sites run from single droplet on DO. Let's see if i could do that.
